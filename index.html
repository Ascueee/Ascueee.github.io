												<a href="https://wrongroommedia.itch.io/nightmare-fuel"><h4>üìéNightmare Fuel | Jan 2023 - April 2023</h4></a>
												<p>Nightmare Fuel is a 2D retro rhythm runner that was developed using Unity2D in my first year. I was tasked with the programming and design of the game. During the development period, I was tasked with being part of the design process for the gameplay systems of nightmare fuel while also being tasked with implementing and programming those same systems. These include: the note rythm mechanics, different note types, "juice" effects (screen shakes) and feedback effects such as a glitch effect when the player is hit. In addition, I was able to experience first hand the development cycle as well as gain experience working and collaborating with other designers and artists.</p>

												<a href="https://github.com/Ascueee/Trek_GDW3"><h4>üìéTrek | Sep 2023 - April 2024</h4></a>
												<p>Trek is a 3D first person platformer I am currently working on with a team of three other people in Unity3D. I'm currently the only programmer on the team so I have been tasked with programming the gameplay systems, UI systems, and shaders using the Universal Render Pipeline(URP) and shader graph. Some examples of the gameplay features I have worked on is the advanced movement system with wall running, slope detection, and crouching. In addition to this I have implemented a custom dialogue system for easy npc dialogue creation, as well as a grapple hook powerup for a more engaging platformer experience.</p>

												<a href="https://github.com/Ascueee/MarioKartWiiAI_Challeneg2"><h4>üìéRace Kart AI | Nov 2023 - Nov 2023</h4></a>
												<p> This was a AI system that I developed inspired by Mario Kart with a dynamic way point system for easy to use track creation, that uses linear interpolation and cubic splines to create a path for the kart to follow. The Kart also uses a state machine to switch between flee and follow behaviours to stay on the track while also being able to avoid obstacles on the track.</p>

												<a href="https://github.com/Ascueee/MarioKartWiiAI_Challeneg2"><h4>üìéSuper Mario Galaxy UI and Menus | Sep 2023 - Oct 2023 </h4></a>
												<p> I was tasked for an assignment to pick a game and to recreate UI elements from that game in the Unity game engine. For this project I decided to pick Super Mario Galaxy and specifically the opening menus of the game. To achieve this a menu manager script was used in combination with LeanTween a animation and lerp tool to recreate the smooth transitions between the different UI elements. </p>

												<a href="https://github.com/Ascueee/MarioKartWiiAI_Challeneg2"><h4>üìéMotion Capture Dark Souls Recreation | Nov 2023 - Dec 2023</h4></a>
												<p> Worked with a partner to use motion capture to recreate animations from a game, we decided to pick Darksouls 3 player animations. Worked with setting up, callibrating, recording, and cleaning up motion capture data for in engine use. In addition, implemented the animations onto a model with blend trees and a state change script to smoothly transition animations with a simple button press. This was done also with the addition of inverse kinematics(ik) to polish up the animations on the model and to ground the animations to the terrain.</p>
