												<a href="https://wrongroommedia.itch.io/nightmare-fuel"><h4>üìé Nightmare Fuel | Jan 2023 - April 2023</h4></a>
												<p>Nightmare Fuel is a 2D retro rhythm runner that was developed using Unity2D in my first year. I was tasked with the programming and design of the game. During the development period, I was tasked with being part of the design process for the gameplay systems of nightmare fuel while also being tasked with implementing and programming those same systems. These include: the note rythm mechanics, different note types, "juice" effects (screen shakes) and feedback effects such as a glitch effect when the player is hit. In addition, I was able to experience first hand the development cycle as well as gain experience working and collaborating with other designers and artists.</p>

												<a href="https://github.com/Ascueee/BattleBox"><h4>üìé Battle Box | July 2024 - Aug 2024</h4></a>
												<p>Battlebox is a solo project I worked on and its a AI based sandbox game where players can use their imagination to create battles with numerous types of troops. This project uses the unity physics system to control AI to their desired location, while also having collision detection for slopes, walls, and enemy troops to make them feel like real battling soldeirs.</p>

											<div class="inner">
												<a href="https://github.com/Ascueee/MarioKartWiiAI_Challeneg2"><h4>üìé Race Kart AI | Nov 2023 - Nov 2023</h4></a>
												<p> This was a AI system that I developed inspired by Mario Kart with a dynamic way point system for easy to use track creation, that uses linear interpolation and cubic splines to create a path for the kart to follow. The Kart also uses a state machine to switch between flee and follow behaviours to stay on the track while also being able to avoid obstacles on the track.</p>

												<a href="https://github.com/Ascueee/SMGUIRecreation"><h4>üìé Super Mario Galaxy UI and Menus | Sep 2023 - Oct 2023 </h4></a>
												<p> I was tasked for an assignment to pick a game and to recreate UI elements from that game in the Unity game engine. For this project I decided to pick Super Mario Galaxy and specifically the opening menus of the game. To achieve this a menu manager script was used in combination with LeanTween a animation and lerp tool to recreate the smooth transitions between the different UI elements. </p>

												<a href="https://github.com/Ascueee/DarkSoulsMotionCap_Challenge3"><h4>üìé Motion Capture Dark Souls Recreation | Nov 2023 - Dec 2023</h4></a>
												<p> Worked with a partner to use motion capture to recreate animations from a game, we decided to pick Darksouls 3 player animations. Worked with setting up, callibrating, recording, and cleaning up motion capture data for in engine use. In addition, implemented the animations onto a model with blend trees and a state change script to smoothly transition animations with a simple button press. This was done also with the addition of inverse kinematics(ik) to polish up the animations on the model and to ground the animations to the terrain.</p>
